Once upon a time. There was a little cat, named Perla.
 She was a very beautiful cat. She had beautiful kittens as well. One of this kitten was a little trouble maker.
She just wanted to see the world and one day she left the house to go into the garden. Suddenly, she saw a swallow 
bird landing on a twig. She was fascinated and didn't know how to react.
